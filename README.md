# Machine Learning Library

A lightweight Java library for binary classification. This project provides multiple classification algorithms, evaluation metrics, and a JavaFX GUI for an interactive experience.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms:**  
  Choose from various classifiers including:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Perceptron
  - Logistic Regression
  - (Additional classifiers can be added easily)

- **Training & Testing:**  
  Easily train models and test them using built-in capabilities.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Evaluate performance with metrics such as:
  - Confusion Matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)
  - Recall, F1 Score, and more

- **Data Handling:**  
  Supports reading data from CSV files (or other sources) and serializing trained models for later use.

- **Interactive GUI (Optional):**  
  A JavaFX-based interface lets you:
  - Choose input files
  - Select classifiers and adjust hyperparameters
  - Configure train-test splits
  - View results and performance summaries
